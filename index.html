 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This beginner-level tutorial covers the basics of audio production. It is suitable for anyone wanting to learn more about working with sound, 
  in either amateur or professional situations. The tutorial is five pages and takes about 20 minutes to complete.<br>  </p>



  <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > What is "Audio"? <br> </h2>

 
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Audio means "of sound" or "of the reproduction of sound". Specifically, it refers to the range of frequencies detectable by the human ear — approximately 
  20Hz to 20kHz. It's not a bad idea to memories those numbers — 20Hz is the lowest-pitched (bassist) sound we can hear, 20kHz is the highest pitch we can hear.<br> </p>
 
   
   
 
  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Audio work involves the production, recording, manipulation and reproduction of sound waves. To understand audio you must have a grasp of two things: <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >  1.	Sound Waves: What they are, how they are produced and how we hear them.   <br>  </p>
   
 
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >  2.	Sound Equipment: What the different components are, what they do, how to choose the correct equipment and use it properly.    <br>  </p>




 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >   Fortunately it's not particularly difficult. Audio theory is simpler than video theory and once you understand the basic path from the sound source through the sound equipment to the ear, it all starts to make sense.
  Technical note: In physics, sound is a form of energy known as acoustical energy.   <br> </p>




  <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >   The Field of Audio Work  <br> </h2>





 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >  The field of audio is vast, with many areas of specialty. Hobbyists use audio for all sorts of things, and audio professionals can be found in a huge range of vocations. Some common areas of audio work include:  <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > In addition, many other professions require a level of audio proficiency. For example, video camera operators should know enough about audio to be able to record good quality sound with their pictures. <br> </p>



 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Speaking of video-making, it's important to recognize the importance of audio in film and video. A common mistake amongst amateurs is to concentrate only on the vision and 
  assume that as long as the microphone is working the audio will be fine. However, satisfactory audio requires skill and effort. Sound is critical to the flow of the programme — 
  indeed in many situations high quality sound is more important than high quality video.<br>  </p>


  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >  Most jobs in audio production require some sort of specialist skill set, whether it be micing up a drum kit or creating synthetic sound effects. 
  Before you get too carried away with learning specific tasks, you should make sure you have a general grounding in the principles of sound. Once you have done this homework you will be well placed to begin specializing. <br> </p>



  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > The first thing to tackle is basic sound wave theory... <br> </p>




  <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> How Sound Waves Work  <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Before you learn how sound equipment works it's very important to understand how sound waves work. This knowledge will form the foundation of everything you do in the field of audio. <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Sound waves exist as variations of pressure in a medium such as air. They are created by the vibration of an object, which causes the air surrounding it to vibrate. The vibrating air then causes the human eardrum to vibrate, which the brain interprets as sound. <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Sound waves travel through air in much the same way as water waves travel through water. In fact, since water waves are easy to see and understand, they are often used as an analogy to illustrate how sound waves behave. <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Sound waves can also be shown in a standard x vs y graph, as shown here. This allows us to visualize and work with waves from a mathematical point of view. The resulting curves are known as the "waveform" (i.e. the form of the wave.) <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The wave shown here represents a constant tone at a set frequency. You will have heard this noise being used as a test or identification signal. This "test tone" creates a nice smooth wave which is ideal for technical purposes. Other sounds create far more erratic waves. <br>  </p>

  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Note that a waveform graph is two-dimensional but in the real-world sound waves are three-dimensional. 
    The graph indicates a wave traveling along a path from left to right, but real sound waves travel in an expanding sphere from the source. However,
     the 2-dimensional model works fairly well when thinking about how sound travels from one place to another. <br>  </p>

  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The next thing to consider is what the graph represents; that is, what it means when the wave hits a high or low point.
     The following explanation is a simplified way of looking at how sound waves work and how they are represented as a waveform. Don't take it too 
     literally — treat it as a useful way to visualize what's going on. <br>  </p>

  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In an electronic signal, high values represent high positive voltage. When this signal is converted to a sound wave, 
    you can think of high values as representing areas of increased air pressure. When the waveform hits a high point, this corresponds to molecules of air
     being packed together densely. When the wave hits a low point the air molecules are spread more thinly. <br>  </p>


  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In the diagram below, the black dots represent air molecules. As the loudspeaker vibrates, it causes the surrounding molecules
     to vibrate in a particular pattern represented by the waveform. The vibrating air then causes the listener's eardrum to vibrate in the same pattern. Voilà — Sound! <br>  </p>

   <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Note that air molecules do not actually travel from the loudspeaker to the ear (that would be wind). Each individual molecule 
    only moves a small distance as it vibrates, but it causes the adjacent molecules to vibrate in a rippling effect all the way to the ear. <br>  </p>


   <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Now here's the thing: All audio work is about manipulating sound waves. The end result of your work is this series of high- 
    and low-pressure zones. That's why it's so important to understand how they work - they are the "material" of your art. <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > A sound mixer is a device which takes two or more audio signals, mixes them together and provides one or more output signals. The diagram on the right shows a simple mixer with six inputs and two outputs. <br>  </p>
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > As well as combining signals, mixers allow you to adjust levels, enhance sound with equalization and effects, create monitor feeds, record various mixes, etc. <br>  </p>
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Mixers come in a wide variety of sizes and designs, from small portable units to massive studio consoles. The term mixer can refer to any type of sound mixer; the terms sound desk and sound console refer to mixers which sit on a desk surface as in a studio setting. <br>  </p>
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Sound mixers can look very intimidating to the newbie because they have so many buttons and other controls. However, once you understand how they work you realise that many of these controls are duplicated and it's not as difficult as it first seems. <br>  </p>
 <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Applications <br> </h2>
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Some of the most common uses for sound mixers include: <br>  </p>
 <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Music studios and live performances: Combining different instruments into a stereo master mix and additional monitoring mixes. <br> </li>
 
 <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Television studios: Combining sound from microphones, tape machines and other sources. <br> </li>
 
 <li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Field shoots: Combining multiple microphones into 2 or 4 channels for easier recording.<br> </li>
 
 <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Channels <br> </h2>
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Mixers are frequently described by the number of channels they have. For example, a "12-channel mixer" has 12 input channels, i.e. you can plug in 12 separate input sources. You might also see a specification such as "24x4x2" which means 24 input channels, 4 subgroup channels and two output channels. <br>  </p>
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > More channels means more flexibility, so more channels is generally better. See mixer channels for more information. <br>  </p>

 <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Input Channels <br> </h2>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > On most sound desks, input channels take up most of the space. All those rows of knobs are channels. Exactly what controls each channel has depends on the mixer but most mixers share common features. The list below details the controls available on a typical mixer channel. <br>  </p>
  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Input Gain / Attenuation: The level of the signal as it enters the channel. In most cases this will be a pot (potentiometer) knob which adjusts the level. The idea is to adjust the levels of all input sources (which will be different depending on the type of source) to an ideal level for the mixer. There may also be a switch or pad which will increase or decrease the level by a set amount (e.g. mic/line switch). <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Pan & Assignment: Each channel can be panned left or right on the master mix. Advanced mixers also allow the channel to be "assigned" in various ways, e.g. sent directly to the main mix or sent only to a particular subgroup. <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Larger sound desks usually have a set of subgroups, which provide a way to sub-mix groups of channels before they are sent to the main output mix. For example, you might have 10 input channels for the drum mics which are assigned to 2 subgroup channels, which in turn are assigned to the master mix. This way you only need to adjust the two subgroup sliders to adjust the level of the entire drum kit. <br>  </p>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > There are no hard-and-fast rules about what type of equipment uses each type of connector, but here are some general guidelines: <br>  </p> 


 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  XLR
 Microphones and some audio devices. Usually balanced audio, but XLRs can also accommodate unbalanced signals.
 6.5mm Jack
 Musical instruments such as electric guitars, as well as various audio devices. Mono jacks are unbalanced, stereo jacks can be either unbalanced stereo or balanced mono.
 RCA
 Musical devices such as disc players, effects units, etc.  <br>  </p>

 <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Input Levels <br> </h2>
 
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The level of an audio signal refers to the voltage level of the signal. Signals can be divided into three categories: Mic-level (low), line-level (a bit higher) and loudspeaker-level (very high). Microphones produce a mic-level signal, whereas most audio devices such as disc players produce a line-level signal. Loudspeaker-level signals are produced by amplifiers and are only appropriate for plugging into a speaker — never plug a loudspeaker-level signal into anything else.  <br>  </p> 
 
 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Sound mixers must be able to accommodate both mic-level and line-level signals. In some cases there are two separate inputs for each channel and you select the appropriate one. It is also common to include some sort of switch to select between inputs and/or signal levels.  <br>  </p>

 <h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Input Sockets and Controls <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The example on the right shows the input connections on a typical mixer. This mixer has two input sockets — an XLR for mic-level inputs and a 6.5mm jack for line-level inputs. It also has a pad button which reduces the input level (gain) by 20dB. This is useful when you have a line-level source that you want to plug into the mic input. <br>  </p> 

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Some mixers also offer RCA inputs or digital audio inputs for each channel. Some mixers provide different sockets for different channels, for example, XLR for the first 6 channels and RCA for the remainder.  <br>  </p> 
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Input Gain <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > When a signal enters the mixer, one of the first controls is the input gain. This is a knob which adjusts the signal level before it continues to the main parts of the channel. The input gain is usually set once when the source is plugged in and left at the same level — any volume adjustments are made by the channel fader rather than the gain control.  <br>  </p> 
Set the gain control so that when the fader is at 0dB the signal is peaking around 0dB on the VU meters.
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Other Controls and Considerations <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Phasing: Some equipment and cables are wired with different phasing, that is, the wires in the cable which carry the signal are arranged differently. This will kill any sound from that source. To fix this problem, some mixers have a phase selector which will change the phasing at the input stage. <br>  </p> 

<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code">  Phantom Power: Some mixers have the option to provide a small voltage back up the input cable to power a microphone or other device  <a href=" https://www.mediacollege.com/audio/phantom-power/   "

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Most mixers have some of sort equalization controls for each channel. Channel equalizers use knobs (rather than sliders), and can be anything from simple tone controls to multiple parametric controls.<br>  </p> 

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The first example on the right is a simple 2-way equalizer, sometimes referred to as bass/treble or low/high. The upper knob adjusts high frequencies (treble) and the lower knob adjusts low frequencies (bass). This is a fairly coarse type of equalization, suitable for making rough adjustments to the overall tone but is not much use for fine control.<br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This next example is a 4-way equalizer. The top and bottom knobs are simple high and low frequency adjustments (HF and LF). <br>  </p> 
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code">  The middle controls consist of two pairs of knobs. These pairs are parametric equalizers — each pair works together to adjust a frequency range chosen by the operator. <a href=" https://www.mediacollege.com/audio/eq/parametric.html    " 
target="_blank">  The brown knob selects the frequency range to adjust and the green knob makes the adjustment.  </a> </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The top pair works in the high-mid frequency range (0.6KHz to 10KHz), the lower pair works in the low-mid range (0.15 to 2.4KHz). <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The "EQ" button below the controls turns the equalization on and off for this channel. This lets you easily compare the treated and untreated sound.
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > It is common for mixers with parametric equalizers to combine each pair of knobs into a single 2-stage knob with one on top of the other. This saves space which is always a bonus for mixing consoles. <br>  </p> 

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">   Notes About Channel Equalization <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > If the mixer provides good parametric equalization you will usually find that these controls are more than adequate for equalizing individual sources. If the mixer is limited to very simple equalization, you may want to use external equalizers. For example, you could add a graphic equalizer to a channel using the insert feature. <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In many situations you will use additional equalization outside the mixer. In live sound situations, for example, you will probably have at least one stereo graphic equalizer on the master output.<br>  </p>

  <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The example below shows a four-channel mixer, with the main signal paths shown in green. Each input channel includes an auxiliary channel control knob — 
    this adjusts the level of the signal sent to the auxiliary output (shown in blue). The auxiliary output is the sum of the signals sent from each channel. If a particular channel's auxiliary knob 
    is turned right down, that channel is not contributing to the auxiliary channel. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Pan <br> </h2>
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code"> Almost all stereo mixers allow you to assign the amount of panning. This is a knob which goes from full left to full right.

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Assign <br> </h2> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This option may be absent on smaller mixers but is quite important on large consoles. The assigned buttons determine where the channel signal is sent. <br>  </p>  
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In many situations the signal is simply sent to the main master output. In small mixers with no assigned controls this happens automatically. <br>  </p>  
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > However you may not want a channel to be fed directly into the main mix. The most common alternative is to send the channel to a subgroup first. For example, you could send all the drum microphones to their own dedicated subgroup which is then sent to the main mix. This way, you can adjust the overall level of all the drums by adjusting the subgroup level. <br>  </p>

<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> 1-2: The channel goes to subgroup 1 and/or 2.

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Note: PFL is often pronounced "piffel". <br>  </p> 
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code"> When you press the PFL button, the main monitor output will stop monitoring anything else and the only audio will be the selected PFL channel(s). This does not affect the main output mix —  <a href=" https://www.mediacollege.com/glossary/b/bus.html     " target="_blank">   just the sound you hear on the monitor bus. Note that all selected PFL channels will be monitored, so you can press as many PFL buttons as you like. </a> </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > A slider is a potentiometer, or variable resistor. This is a simple control which varies the amount of resistance and therefore the signal level.

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > As a rule it is desirable to run the fader around the 0dB mark for optimum sound quality, although this will obviously vary a lot. <br>  </p> 
Remember that there are two ways to adjust a channel's level: The input gain and the output fader. Make sure the input gain provides a strong signal level to the channel without clipping and leave it at that level — use the fader for ongoing adjustments.


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Sound Mixers: Subgroups <br> </h2>
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code">  Subgroups are a way to "pre-mix" a number of channels on a sound console before sending them to the master output mix. In the following diagram, channels 1 and 2 are assigned directly to the master output bus. Channels 3,4,5 and 6 are assigned to subgroup 1, <a href=" https://www.mediacollege.com/glossary/b/bus.html     " target="_blank"> which in turn is assigned to the master output. </a> </p>






<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Subgroups have many uses and advantages, the most obvious being that you can pre-mix (sub-mix) groups of inputs.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > For example, if you have six backing vocalists you can set up a good mix just for them, balancing each voice to get a nice overall effect. If you then send all six channels to one subgroup, you can adjust all backing vocals with a single subgroup slider while still maintaining the balance between the individual voices.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Note that if your mixing console's subgroups are mono, you will need to use them in pairs to maintain a stereo effect. For each pair, one subgroup is the left channel and the other is right. Each channel can be panned across the two subgroups, while the subgroups are panned completely left and right into the master output bus.  <br>  </p> 

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Sound Mixers: Outputs <br> </h2>

The main output from most mixing devices is a stereo output, using two output sockets which should be fairly obvious and easy to locate. The connectors are usually 3-pin XLRs on larger consoles, but can also be 6.5mm TR (jack) sockets or RCA sockets.
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code">  The main output  <a href=" https://www.mediacollege.com/hardware/connectivity/connectors/xlr/   "

target="_blank"> RCA  </a> </p>


The level of the output signal is monitored on the mixer's VU meters. The ideal is for the level to peak at around 0dB or just below. However you should note that the dB scale is relative and 0dB on one mixer may not be the same as 0dB on another mixer or audio device. For this reason it is important to understand how each device in the audio chain is referenced, otherwise you may find that your output signal is unexpectedly high or low when it reaches the next point in the chain.

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In professional circles, the nominal level of 0dB is considered to be +4 dBu. Consumer-level equipment tends to use -10 dBV.  <br>  </p> 
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code"> The best way to check the levels of different equipment is to use audio test tone.  <a href="  https://www.mediacollege.com/audio/tone/   "

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Many mixers include a number of additional outputs, for example:  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Monitor Feed: A dedicated monitor feed which can be adjusted independently of the master output.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Headphones: The headphone output may be the same as the monitor feed, or you may be able to select separate sources to listen to.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Auxiliary Sends: The output(s) of the mixer's auxiliary channels.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Subgroup Outputs: Some consoles have the option to output each subgroup independently.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Communication Channels: Some consoles have additional output channels available for communicating with the stage, recording booths, etc.  <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> File Formats <br> </h2>
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >  Understanding WAVE vs MP3 <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Wave  is an uncompressed or lossless format, whereas MP3  is compressed or lossy. Technically .wav is just a container format and can hold various types of compressed or uncompressed audio, but typically you'll see it containing LPCM (Links to an external site.) uncompressed audio (the same as on audio CDs). With .wav files, you are essentially getting a raw bitstream representation of the audio signal in digital form. An analog sound produced in the real world contains essentially an infinite amount of information because it is a wave that is constantly changing (see below). In order to bring these sounds into the digital domain you need to sample the signal at various intervals to make an approximation of the sound. For .wav the audio signal is usually sampled at 44,100 times per second or more, and each sampled value is recorded so the sound wave can be reproduced:  <br>  </p>  










<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The analog sound wave is sampled at every T interval to make a digital approximation of the original signal. (For digital audio T is usually 1/44,100th of a second or less) <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > MP3s are compressed in order to squeeze the same audio information into a smaller file size. The .wav format is great for very faithful representations of the analog signal, but as you probably know that's usually at the cost of larger file sizes. Compressed audio (and video in a similar fashion) is designed to reduce the file size while still maintaining a respectable level of fidelity.  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In layman's terms, compression attempts to remove the unnecessary data from the stream and reduce the signal to its most necessary components. With MP3, the compression and encoding algorithms use a model of how we hear to analyze the audio in the frequency domain and remove any unnecessary information. For instance, due to auditory masking (Links to an external site.) if there are two sounds at close frequencies, often we will only hear the louder one if the difference in volume between the two is significant. So for MP3, the lower volume sound could be discarded and the audio would sound essentially the same to our ears. More info on the technical side of MP3 encoding here. (Links to an external site.)  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In practice, both .wav and MP3 have their uses. For production, .wav is the standard because it will almost always be a 100% accurate, bit-for-bit reproduction of the source material. MP3s can be a decent alternative at high enough bitrates. The bitrate is the measure of how many bits per second the MP3 encoding will use, meaning the higher the bitrate, the closer the MP3 will be to the original, uncompressed stream. Bitrate is usually measured in kilobits per second (kbps). I like high audio quality for my digital music collection, so when I have the option I usually encode MP3s at a constant 256 or 320kbps. That is the higher end of what MP3s are capable of, and unfortunately a lot of digital music out there is not encoded that high. When the bitrate comes down, you can usually hear it first in the high frequencies, for example the cymbals from a drum kit will sound off. 160kbps is tolerable, but anything lower than that and you will really start to notice. But again, with a high enough bitrate the differences between MP3 and .wav are barely distinguishable, especially to an untrained listener (most listeners).  <br>  </p> 
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > For .wav files we mostly look at bit depth and sample rate or frequency. Bit depth is the number of bits used to encode each sampled value. The sample rate tells how many times per second the audio is sampled. CD (.wav) and MP3 are encoded at 44,100 Hz sample rate (Hertz meaning "cycles per second"). Newer computers and audio hardware/software are now accommodating higher sample rates, including 48kHz or 96kHz. For .wav the bit depth is usually 16-bits or 24-bits on the newer systems. For most purposes, when using .wav, 16-bit and 44.1kHz is sufficient, but if you have the capabilities it's usually worth upgrading to 24-bit, 48kHz. <br>  </p> 
Some example file sizes for a stereo five minute recording: <br>  </p> 
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> .wav, 16-bit, 44.1kHz: 50 MB<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> .wav, 24-bit, 48kHz: 82 MB <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> .wav, 24-bit, 96kHz: 164 MB <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> MP3, 128kbps, 44.1kHz: 4.5 MB <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> MP3, 192kbps, 44.1kHz: 7 MB <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> MP3, 320kbps, 44.1kHz: 11 MB <br> </li>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  There is also a variable bitrate option for MP3 encoding, which should offer slightly smaller file sizes for the same quality. It uses an encoding scheme that changes (varies) the bitrate for different portions of the song depending on complexity and how many samples would be needed to recreate a given section faithfully. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" >   Differences between Microphones <br> </h2>



<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Dynamic microphones <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > These are the most common general-purpose microphones. They do not require power to operate. If you have a microphone that is used for live performance, it is probably a dynamic mic.<br>  </p>


<img src=" https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGknhsExn5MRWFVyPtrAo9yOy70yfDVlE0nAHuNZrm4fqzQVBOldIlY7TYQCd2QIRnbetde3Pm88NCOPM8jBGBQDnAXAqMhJQ8eRQyA_sTIhTZqnbErnBi0ilXuzriLTTjfxDKYbm8Ne7qi2oAvANv0IMRNux_fcbeWIHl-1i5GqaRs4SCvxPKuRSc34w/s3840/i24.PNG "

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  They have the advantage that they can withstand very high sound pressure levels (high volume) without damage or distortion, and tend to provide a richer, more intense sound than other types. Traditionally, these mics did not provide as good a response on the highest frequencies (particularly above 10 kHz), but some recent models have come out that attempt to overcome this limitation. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  In the studio, dynamic mics are often used for high sound pressure level instruments such as drums, guitar amps and brass instruments. Models that are often used in recording include the Shure SM57 and the Sennheiser MD421. <br>  </p>
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Condenser microphones <br> </h2>


<img src=" https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjknBEHM2jAD7xd2xPzMHqWFwVPfBgFa6BGd31EokpuvnxI9mxyty4kkNS1Fy22T3j-Y_EKHYlq2ejkRS1SCWenFHLm3Xn0agO2mewrh4e6-ijrXos9DXmsRamCCmyJyNfWkZJlPInEfZAT_ssydHxHHZ983Kg2qbYASOqXw8jxGhh8c8ffwBrvS5UUwi0/s3840/i23.PNG "
style="width:50%" onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt=" # "> 


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  These microphones are often the most expensive microphones a studio owns. They require power to operate, either from a battery or phantom power, provided using the mic cable from an external mixer or pre-amp. 
  These mics have a built-in pre-amplifier that uses the power. Some vintage microphones have a tube amplifier, and are referred to as tube condensers.  <br>  </p> 


  <img src=" https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNKar0TrNeaV6OpB84mB1OeVBY0pl3Bt-rFwBEDW5tsAshlbIkBse16pQS_KN6ov2BURLMx5-HctbpDX9JIuEKZs7UepofUYjaJl8200zLqaJ6DZgFKRBehEzYehmcLL_Ih0qc0ZTeLEDRk2ljptu-FC9CNrUJ3h1_Tb86Oyx6mtytzn8g-raW-o0b3LE/s3840/i22.PNG "

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  While they cannot withstand the very high sound pressure levels that dynamic mics can, they provide a flatter frequency response, and often the best response at the highest frequencies. Not as good at conveying intensity, they are much better at providing a balanced accurate sound.  <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  Condenser mics come with a variety of sizes of transducers. They are usually grouped into smaller format condensers, which often are long cylinders about the size of a nickel coin in diameter, and larger format condensers, the transducers of which are often about an inch in diameter or slightly larger. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  In the studio, condenser mics are often used for instruments with a wide frequency range, such as an acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, voice, violin, cymbals, or an entire band or chorus. On louder instruments they do not use close miking with condensers.
  
  Models that are often used in recording include the Shure SM81 (small format), AKG C414 (large format) and Neumann U87 (large format).  <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" >  Ribbon microphones <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  Ribbon microphones are often used as an alternative to condenser microphones. Some modern ribbon microphones do not require power, and some do. The first ribbon microphones, developed at RCA in the 1930s, 
  required no power, were quite fragile and could be destroyed by just blowing air through them. Modern ribbon mics are much more resilient, and can be used with the same level of caution as condenser mics.  <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  Ribbon microphones provide a warmer sound than a condenser mic, with a less brittle top end. Some vocalists (including Paul McCartney) prefer them to condenser mics. In the studio they are used on vocals, violins, and even drums. Popular models for recording include the Royer R121 and the AEA R84.  <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Understanding Dispersion Specifications <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Many pro-audio manufacturers publish dispersion specifications. These are commonly quoted as xx degrees. For example: “90 degrees”.  <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  Correctly, these dispersion figures should be qualified by both the frequency and dB difference from the on axis SPL. For example: “90 degrees -3dB @ 1kHz”. That would mean that at 1kHz the speaker covers an angle of 90 degrees with a nominal difference from the on axis SPL of 3dB. For what it’s worth, the accepted pro-audio “standard” is to quote dispersion figures at -6dB and 1kHz.  <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  One important thing to understand is what the angular coverage refers to. This is a source of potential confusion for those reading and interpreting specifications.  <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  A dispersion figure of 90 degrees means 45 degrees either side of “on axis”. Likewise a dispersion figure of 80 degrees would mean 40 degrees either side of “on axis”.  So if you saw a published specification of 90 degrees with no frequency or dB qualifier, you’d assume this means that if you measured the speaker at 45 degrees off axis you’d see that at 1kHz the response is -6dB down.  <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  At Acoustic Frontiers we don’t think this is a very useful standard for home theater design or acoustic design for two reasons. We think -3dB at 4kHz is a better specification for our purposes:  <br>  </p>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  Firstly, -6dB is a very significant perceptual change in SPL. We prefer -3dB, which is around a 20% perceived loudness difference. <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  Secondly, 1kHz is not a high enough frequency to cover the main energy output of popular musical instruments or the key frequencies that contribute to localization. 4kHz is a better frequency for this purpose. <br> </li>










<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Compression, Limiting, Expanding <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > These three things: Compression, Limiting and Expanding all have to do with finessing the dynamic range of your mix. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > I like to think of Limiting as the harshest option -- where you simply cut anything above a certain loudness. If you want to be a little more forgiving, you can use a compressor to more subtly adjust the dynamic range. Expanding is pretty much the opposite of compressing: Expanders increase the difference in loudness between quieter and louder sections of audio making quiet sounds quieter and loud sounds louder. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > A compressor/limiter/expander is a circuit designed to allow you to change the range between the loudest and quietest parts of a signal. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > All three have similar adjustments for you to consider when using them in your mix: <br>  </p>
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Threshold <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Imagine the compressor as a sort of loudness enforcer who says, “As long as the level stays below this point, it’s within the rules and I won’t touch it. But if it crosses this line, I’m going to turn it down.” The threshold control is how we tell our compressor precisely where to draw this boundary. Obviously, this needs to be set differently depending on the input signal. If set too high, the entire signal will remain unaffected below the threshold. If set too low, undesired over-compression and distortion can occur.  <br>  </p>


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Ratio <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The ratio determines, proportionally, how much the signal gets turned down once it crosses the threshold. A 4:1 ratio setting tells the enforcer, “If this signal tries to go 4 dB over the line, you only let it go 1 dB.” A signal 8 dB over the threshold would only be allowed to go 2 dB above, and so on and so forth.  <br>  </p>


<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  A 1:1 ratio represents no compression at all. <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  A very high ratio of 100:1 is like building a brick wall right at the threshold. Nothing is getting past that line. This makes our compressor act as a limiter. <br> </li>
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Knee <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > A less-common control is knee, which allows you to dial in a variable ratio that compresses harder the further you pass the threshold. A “soft” knee is like an enforcer who shows some leniency to misdemeanor-level offenders who only put a toe over the line. <br>  </p>


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Attack <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This control determines how quickly or lazily our automatic volume control turns itself down once the threshold is crossed. Faster attack times ask the compressor to turn the volume down very quickly, while slower attack times tell it to respond more gradually.  <br>  </p>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Some compressor plugins have a “look-ahead” function, which turns our enforcer into a psychic that can see into the future and anticipate the signal’s moves, allowing instantaneous attack times not possible in the analog domain.  <br>  </p>


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Release <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The release, or recovery time, determines the rate at which our automatic volume control turns itself back up once the signal falls back below the threshold. Set at a fast extreme, our enforcer lets up on its pushback rather suddenly as soon as the signal is back in bounds.  <br>  </p>


 

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Reverb, Phasing, Flanging, Chorus <br> </h2>
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Reverb <br> </h2>
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code"> microphone <a href=" https://www.voices.com/blog/microphone-sweetspot/       " target="_blank"> setups </a> </p>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Reverberation is important because it gives a sense of space. Reverb is about adding the characteristics of an acoustic environment, either by creating simple echoes or by simulating more complex patterns of sonic reflections. <br>  </p>
<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code"> Check out the following articles that explain different kinds of reverb (with audio examples) <a href=" https://flypaper.soundfly.com/produce/artificial-space-place-reverb-tech-primer/       " target="_blank">

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Phasing <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Phase-shifting, AKA phasing, is an audio effect which takes advantage of the way sound waves interact with each other when they are out of phase. By splitting an audio signal into two signals and changing the relative phasing between them, a variety of interesting sweeping effects can be created. <br>  </p>


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Flanging <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  >  Flanging is an audio process that combines two copies of the same signal , with the second delayed slightly, to produce a swirling effect. The process originated before digital effect boxes and computer editing were available. The effect, invented in the early 1950s by Les Paul and later used by artists such as Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles, was originally created using two tape recorders. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;">  Chorus <br> </h2>

 <p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The chorus effect has the longest delay of all the modulation effects, and is commonly used for doubling vocals or instruments. Chorus works by adding multiple short delays to the signal, but rather than repeating the same delay, each delay is "variable length" (the speed and length of the delay changes). This adds the randomness required for the chorus sound. Varying the delay time also varies the pitch slightly, further adding to the "multiple sources" illusion. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Distortion & Feedback <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Typically, distortion and feedback are two things you want to avoid when processing your audio.  <br>  </p>
 
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Distortion <br> </h2>

<p style= "text-align:left;" class="code">  Unwanted distortion is caused by a signal which is "too strong". If an audio signal level is too high for a particular component to cope with, then parts of the signal will be lost. <a href=" https://www.mediacollege.com/audio/howto/distortion.html          " target="_blank">
This results in the rasping distorted sound. </a> </p>





<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Feedback <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Audio feedback is the ringing noise (often described as squealing, screeching, etc) sometimes present in sound systems. It is caused by a "looped signal", that is, a signal which travels in a continuous loop. In technical terms,

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > One of the most common feedback situations is shown in the diagram below - a microphone feeds a signal into a sound system, which then amplifies and outputs the signal from a speaker, which is picked up again by the microphone. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Coincident pairs <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In this method (also called crossed pairs and sometimes called the X-Y method, although X-Y is often used to refer to a specific version of coincident pairs) a pair of microphones 
  are set up in such a way that their capsules are almost touching or one is directly above the other and angled apart. In other words the capsules are coincident. (The microphone should not touch one another as 
  this could introduce mechanical noise.) The biggest advantage to this technique is that since the capsules are at the same point, there is no time of arrival differences between the left and right mikes and, 
  therefore, no phase cancellation. This makes the setup mono-compatible. The main disadvantage is that the stereo image is rather narrow, depending solely on differences in level to produce the stereo field.  <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The X-Y technique uses two cardiod microphones in a coincident configuration angled typically at 90 degrees apart (45 degrees to either side of a center line that faces the sound source).  <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The mid-side technique (also called middle-side, mono-stereo, or abbreviated as M-S or M/S). It combines one microphone facing forward at the center of the sound source (the “mid” microphone)
   with a microphone that has a bi-directional (figure-eight) pattern facing left or right (the “side”). The mid microphone can be just about any pattern, but a cardioid pattern seems to be the most common. Some people say matching 
   the two microphones is not necessary, but others say they should be matched as closely as possible, especially for larger sources. A good way to match them is to choose two multi-pattern large diaphragm condenser microphones, 
   with the mid one set to omni or cardioid and the side one set to a figure-eight pattern. Those using unmatched microphones report good results using everything from omni to supercardioid patterns for the mid microphone 
   and even using a mix of condenser and ribbon microphones for the side microphone.  <br>  </p>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Unlike most of the other stereo miking techniques, in which the signal from the two microphones are panned hard left and hard right, 
  this technique requires some signal manipulation to develop the stereo signal. The signal from the mid microphone provides a very good mono signal. Since the two lobes of the 
  figure-eight microphones are picking up essentially sound from the left and right sides of the sound stage (primarily reflected sounds), they can be used to develop the stereo 
  signals by combining them with the mid signal. In a figure-eight microphone, the sound picked by the front (in this case the left side) is 180 degrees out of phase with the rear
   (the right side). So the left portion of the signal can be considered to be a positive signal while the right is a negative one. To create a left channel, you need to add the 
   mid and side signals. To obtain the right channel, you need to subtract the side signal from the mid signal. This can be done in your mixing console or digital audio workstation
    (DAW) by mixing the two signals for the left channel and mixing a polarity-reversed side signal with the mid signal to produce the right channel. Of course,
     if you face the side microphone to the right, this procedure will be reversed.  <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The M-S technique provides good stereo localization, a strong middle image, and excellent mono compatibility. However, 
  possibly its greatest advantage is that the stereo field can be adjusted even after the performance is over. In fact, the polar patterns achieved by an omni
   and figure-eight microphone at right angles is equivalent to two cardioid mics set at 90 degrees apart in an X-Y pattern. The difference is that with M/S 
   you have the ability to adjust the width of the stereo field. By adjusting the ratio of mid signal to side signal, you can achieve anything from a fairly 
   wide stereo image to a rather narrow one. Of course, you can pan the signals with other techniques, but you are only mixing together the left and right signal.
    With M-S you are mixing more or less of the mono signal into the mix, providing greater control over the final mix. <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The Blumlein method consists of a coincident pair of bi-directional (figure-eight) microphones placed at an angle of 90 degrees from one another, with the center line bisecting that angle pointing at the music source. This configuration provides a high degree of stereo separation along with a large amount of room ambience. The Blumlein technique produces a good, natural-sounding stereo image, but the sound quality is greatly influenced by the room acoustics and the size of the sound source. Since it is coincident, it provides excellent mono compatibility. Both condenser and ribbon microphones have been used with this technique. This technique should not be used if room acoustics or audience noise will be a problem. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Near-Coincident pairs <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Since the ears on a human head are spaced several inches apart, engineers have deemed that using a recording technique with the mikes spaced a similar 
  distance should produce a stereo image similar to that of human hearing. That was the original reason for the near-coincident microphone technique, although most current versions no longer 
  try to emulate the size of the human head. The stereo image depends on both time of arrival and intensity differences. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> ORTF <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The ORTF technique, which was developed about 1960 by the Office de Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française, the French broadcasting organization, uses two cardioid microphones spaced 17 cm (6.7 inches) apart and angled at 110 degrees. This method provides a realistic stereo field with acceptable mono compatibility. Using cardioid microphones provides for less ambient noise and effects from room characteristics. <br>  </p>
 
 
 
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Spaced pairs <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This category uses two, sometimes three, microphones pointing forward and spaced several feet apart. Unlike the near-coincident category above, which normally specifies distances between mics to the nearest centimeter, this category usually gives a range of distances such as 3 to 10 feet. The guiding principle in spacing microphones is the 3-to-1 rule. This rule of thumb states that the distance between two mics should be three times the distance from the mics to the sound source. The purpose of this rule is to minimize phase problems. However, with many guidelines in stereo miking, this rule is often easier said than done in typical real world applications. Other factors also come into play when setting up the spacing between microphones. As a general rule, the larger the group being recorded, the wider the spacing should be. However, spacing the microphones too far apart can exaggerate the separation and cause insufficient coverage of the center of the sound stage, creating the “hole-in-the-middle” effect. <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Unlike the near-coincident method, the spaced pair method does not try to emulate human hearing. Using spaced pairs produces a greater spread of the perceived sterero image. The stereo image of spaced pairs is produced by a combination of time differences, level differences, and spectal differences. Most listeners are not listening through headphones, but through a pair of stereo loudspeakers placed several feet apart. Reproducing music that has been recorded with microphones placed several feet apart through such speakers should be a good combination. The disadvantage is that off-center images tend to be unfocused and hard to localize. <br>  </p>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > In AB mic placement two identical microphones are placed, at some distance apart, in front of the source. Omnidirectional microphones are frequently employed for this setup, 
  although directional microphones can be used. This system captures both time of arrival and relative amplitude information, but if the microphones are spaced farther apart than our ears are, as is usually the case,
   the reproduced stereo field can be unnatural sounding. This approach might sound acceptable when listened to on speakers that are also placed far apart. The stereo separation reproduced depends 
   on the distance between the microphones. A “hole” can be created in the middle of the stereo field if the microphones are too far apart. A third microphone is sometimes used in the middle of
    the spaced pair to prevent this effect, but undesirable cancellations may occur if this is not done carefully. Individual microphones (accent microphones) can also be placed near a soloist 
    and combined with the spaced pair if necessary. When using spaced-pair recording techniques, it is helpful to consider the 3-to-1 rule to minimize undesirable phase cancellations:
     the sound sources should be at least three times as far apart as they are from the microphones. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Careers in Music Production & Engineering <br> </h2>



<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Producer  <br> </h2>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The producer plays a variety of roles depending on whether they are working in music, film, theater, dance, video games, or other media. In the music industry, 
  producers often work with recording artists and record labels to create songs and albums for release. The music producer supervises all aspects of the recording process—including
   contracting session players and overseeing the recording budget—and may also help the artist select songs to be recorded. Preferably, a producer should be an excellent 
   musician with a lot of performance experience. In addition to possessing a great depth of knowledge in music, a producer should hold extensive technical knowledge 
   of recording equipment, engineering, and acoustics. A producer must also demonstrate creativity and excellent interpersonal skills. <br>  </p>


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Recording Engineer/Mixer <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The recording engineer operates the mixing console and other equipment during the process of recording music or sound.
   Recording engineers generally run recording sessions, with oversight from the producer. They may also be responsible for setting up equipment in the studio prior to the session, 
   and discussing what the end product should sound like with the producer and talent. It is the engineer’s subsequent responsibility to craft a recording that
    meets all stakeholders’ stated desires. Many engineers are also called upon to be mixers, working with the output of recording sessions to piece
     together a polished finished product. Recording engineers/mixers must possess well-trained ears, advanced technical
      knowledge of recording and mixing tools, and an ingrained understanding of studio etiquette. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Assistant Engineer <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The assistant engineer works in the recording studio and is responsible for assisting the recording engineer with setup,
   recording tracks, and mixing. This person works as directed by the recording engineer. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Production Assistant <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > As the producer's right-hand person, the production assistant handles details for the producer such as contracting 
  talent (musicians/vocalists) for sessions, scheduling studio time, placing telephone calls, sending emails ensuring everyone is aware of when and where 
  the session will be held, assisting on the session, and setting up the equipment in the studio for a session and/or returning it to its proper place after the session. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Studio Manager/Owner <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The studio manager/owner is the person responsible for running the business of the recording studio and may be a sole 
  or partial owner of the business. Studio managers are responsible for booking acts to record at the studio, scheduling engineers, marketing the studio, 
  and budgeting and providing for all the needs of a professional recording studio. The studio manager/owner is also the in-house diplomat, 
  acting as the liaison between engineers and clients, ensuring client satisfaction, and handling all financial transactions with clients. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Sound Technician <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Sound technicians are responsible for high-quality sound during live performance. They usually arrive at the concert sight before the performers
   and are involved in unloading and setting up the equipment and instruments along with the road crew. Sound technicians supervise the placement of equipment and work with the talent during 
   the sound check to achieve the best sound. They may even work a soundboard during the actual performance. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Acoustic Consultant <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Acoustic consultants provide complete audio, video, and acoustic design services for performance spaces such as concert halls, 
  arenas, stadiums, studios, convention facilities, clubs, churches, and synagogues. Acoustical consultants can provide an acoustical analysis of a particular venue, 
  identify acoustical problems, and make suggestions for equipment or interior design changes for fixing any problems. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Audio Engineer for Videos <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This engineer's specialty is making certain that the audio tracks are synchronized and equalized with the video. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Digital Remastering Engineer <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This engineer's responsibility is to take older analog masters, which are on vinyl, 8-track, 
  or audiocassette formats, and remaster them for release on CD or other digital mediums. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Live Sound Engineer <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This engineer's primary responsibility is to operate the soundboard during a live performance. 
  The live sound engineer is also involved in sound check and the placement of equipment in preparation for a live performance. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Recording Equipment Manufacturer's Rep/Customer Service <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > A recording equipment manufacturer's rep will usually work at the company's headquarters in a customer service/tech support role. 
  They will also represent the company at trade shows or conferences and potentially serve as a product demonstrator. Usually, someone with strong playing ability as a musician is selected for this role. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Mastering Engineer (Post-Production Engineer) <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This engineer is responsible for taking the final mixes of recordings that have been sent by a studio,
   band, or artist for finishing touches such as EQ (equalization), overall effects, and possibly compression.  <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Interactive and Mixed Media Specialist <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Interactive and mixed media specialists work to create features for websites, software, and a wide variety of digital multimedia applications. 
  These features may contain sound, music, text, video, images, and/or animation. Interactive and mixed media specialists may be charged with developing and implementing “front-end” 
  content or “back-end” functions, or both. As such, this position requires a broad spectrum of skills, which may include graphic design, web design, web development/computer programming, 
  sound design, editing, and more. Typically, interactive and mixed media specialists are enlisted to help clients meet sales or fundraising goals, so in addition to technical skills, 
  interactive and mixed media specialists should possess an understanding of marketing, communications, and digital user behavior. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Re-Recording Mixer (Film and Video) <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > If a film or business wants to use a particular song for a commercial or movie, they will often re-record the song or
   composition again in order to avoid having to negotiate and pay a hefty master-licensing fee to a record label for use of the actual (master) recording. 
   By rerecording the song, they will only have to pay the mechanical licensing fee, which is a rate that is established by the U.S. government and is much 
   cheaper than a master-licensing fee. Therefore, a re-recording mixer for film and video rerecords a song or composition that has already been commercially released. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Record Company Staff <br> </h2>


<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Many times successful producers and engineers who have a track record of working with and 
  identifying successful artists and bands will be tapped for an executive level position at a record label, to oversee artist development, 
  production, or A&R. These producers and engineers usually have had an exclusive agreement and history or working with the record label for 
  several years, and the success of the producer or engineer has resulted in the success of the label. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Recording Studio Setup Worker <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > This person is generally charged with the responsibilities of setting up for a recording session by arriving
   early before the session musicians, artist, or band and setting up any necessary musical equipment, such as amplifiers, drum set, microphones, 
   running microphone cords, music stands, etc. This person is also generally the last person to leave, since they are left with the
    responsibility of ensuring that all equipment is returned to its proper place. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Studio Designer <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Studio designers provide complete audio, video, and acoustic design services for recording facilities.
   Studio designers can serve as consultants for designing or renovating studios for select and distinct purposes. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Studio Technician/Maintenance <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The studio technician is extremely knowledgeable in the field of electrical engineering, circuitry, and audio electronics. 
  This person may work within the audio manufacturer's headquarters and/or conduct fieldwork, such as visiting a client's studio for customer service–related issues or product repair. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Music Editor <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > A music editor is responsible for mixing and synchronizing music with a visual counterpart, such as a film or video game. 
  The music editor often provides a temporary track that is used as a stand-in for the final score until that score is ready. The music editor must be versatile and possess a 
  great musical sensitivity, a keen ear for balance, and an awareness of how music can make or break a dramatic scene or sequence. In addition, the music editor
   must be familiar with the technology used to mix and synchronize music in conjunction with visual media. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Programmer <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The programmer uses software to produce MIDI keyboard/synthesizer tracks for inclusion in a score for visual media such as film,
   TV, video games, and commercials, or for art installations, live performances, and more. A programmer may also sequence a composition so as to enable the composer,
    music editor, or others an opportunity to hear it—and identify any problematic areas—without having to hire a full orchestra before it reaches its final performance 
    or recording stage. A programmer must possess strong skills with music sequencing software and notation software. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Sound Designer <br> </h2>

<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>  The FOH engineer (Front of House) is responsible for creating the mix of the sound elements on stage that is amplified and heard by the audience (the house). <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The monitor engineer creates the mix of the sound elements for the performers on stage. They typically operate an entirely different system than the FOH engineer and deliver different mixes that are tailored to each performer's needs. The mixes are delivered to monitor wedges on stage or the in-ear monitors of the performers or both.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li>The system engineer is responsible for installing and often designing the sound system for a tour, event or venue. It also includes optimizing the system for the venue/environment. The system tech supports the system engineer and is involved in the system setup including cabling and rigging.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The FOH tech supports the FOH engineer and System Engineer and  assists with EQ/time alignment tasks for system optimization. They also handle all of the show elements besides the main performance, like announcements, pre/post-show music or other media feeds. Sometimes they are also responsible for recording the performance.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The Monitor tech supports the Monitor engineer and System Engineer and assists with the setup of the monitor system and console. They also handle the In-Ear Monitoring Systems (IEMs) and the RF (Radio Frequency) coordination for the wireless systems on stage.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Stage Techs are responsible for setting up the microphones, microphone stands and cables on stage. They also are responsible for patching.<br> </li>
 
<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Audio Production <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Audio production includes producing, recording, editing, mixing and mastering of music, podcasts and audiobooks. Audio production roles are usually in recording or media studios. <br>  </p>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> A recording engineer is responsible for creating the best recording of the performers and sound sources of a project. This could be an artist or musicians in a band or a host and guests of a podcast or an author reading an audiobook. The recording engineer chooses the best microphones and recording equipment to capture each of the sources, sets everything up in the studio, connects everything via the patch bay and makes sure the recording process is seamless for the talent. The recording engineer also edits the material, delivers files to client, mixing engineer, etc. and maintains multiple backups of all of the material.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> A music producer oversees the recording process from working with the artist to booking recording studios and managing the budget and personnel. A music producer works with the artist to translate the aesthetic vision into a recorded product that is competitive in the market. There are multiple types of producers. Some focus on creating the beats and backing tracks, some are more technically trained as recording engineers and some focus more on songwriting and arranging.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> A mix engineer takes the completed multi-track recorded tracks and blends them into a stereo master format that is distributed to the world (after mastering). The mix engineer balances the individual sound elements and uses EQ, dynamic and time-based signal processing to create separation and clarity so that all the elements of the song are heard. While a recording engineer focuses on the best recording of each element, the mix engineer focuses on the best representation of the song as a whole. <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> A vocal producer specializes in helping a singer record their best performance. While a music producer oversees the entire recording process, the vocal producer focuses on the vocal only, from choosing the recording chain to editing to coaching the vocalist to get the best take.<br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> While the mix engineer focuses on the song, the mastering engineer focuses on the album or the collection of the songs and makes sure that they are all in the same space in terms of loudness, frequency balance and dynamics. They work with the artist to create the best song order and transitions and are also the very important last step in quality control of the project. They work in a mastering studio which is a very different setup than a recording studio as it is much more focused on the monitoring environment and quality of the stereo signal chain as opposed to a multi-track environment that needs to deal with a much higher number of sources. <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The term "producer" has evolved over time, especially with more electronic-based music. Producer/beat makers use compositional tools like Ableton Live  (Links to an external site.)and drum machines to create beats and music beds for songs. <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Like a music producer, a podcast producer crafts the overarching story and aesthetic vision of the podcast and oversees the recording process from working with the podcast creator/host and audio engineer to booking recording studios and managing the budget and personnel. <br> </li>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> An audiobook producer is responsible for turning a book into something you can listen to. Critical tasks include casting the perfect readers (the author, voice actors), scheduling recording studio sessions and managing the talent and recording engineer. <br> </li>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Game Audio <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The roles in game audio range from sound design and creating the sonic world of a game to working with composers to create the background music to writing code to trigger the sounds in the game. <br>  </p>
<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> The Audio Director in game sound is similar to the role of Supervising Sound Editor in Film/Video, they oversee the process and staff that create all of the sound and music in a video game. They oversee the creation of the sonic world of the game from hiring voice actors to working with the composer and sound designers. <br> </li>


<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Much like sound designers/editors for film/video, this role in game audio creates the sonic aesthetic of the game's world. However, the game sound designer has to create an auditory world that constantly evolves in response to the player.<br> </li>


<li   li class="code" style= "text-align:left;" ul class="a" li> Audio programmers use and develop tools to integrate sound into a video game.

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Mind the meters while you're recording, mixing, mastering and broadcasting. Every step of the process requires attention to your levels. <br>  </p>


<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;" > Loudness Levels <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > Audio signal or sound levels are measured using a decibel (dB) system. The dB system is used to compare two levels or a change in signal voltage or power. One dB is the level change that is just noticeable by most people. A 6 dB change is considered to be about twice the volume. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The dB scale operates differently depending on whether you're working with Analog or Digital signals. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Analog Loudness <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > dBm: decibels or dB referenced to 1 milliwatt (.001 watt) <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > dBu or dBv: decibels or dB referenced to 0.775 volt (dBu is more commonly used) <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > dBV: decibels or dB referenced to 1 volt <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > VU - Volume unit - device displaying a representation of the signal level in audio equipment. 0 VU is often referred to as "0 dB". The VU meter is a voltmeter with a response time designed to reflect the loudness of live audio as the ear would interpret the loudness. Relating VU measurement units to the other dB units of measurement for audio can only be done with a sine wave test tone. In a professional audio balanced system, 0 VU corresponds to +4 dBu. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > RMS Levels - Root Mean Square Levels - approximates loudness. <br>  </p>

<h2 class="code" style= "text-align:left;"> Digital Loudness <br> </h2>

<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > The dB system in digital audio starts at the top and defines the loudest sound level that is to be digitized. This top or full scale view of the audio levels results in a full scale or "FS" system of dB measurement. A 0 dBFS measurement unit is to be the highest audio level. Assuming this is to be at the highest audio level before clipping occurs, this corresponds to an analog level of 24 dBu. Therefore, 4 dBu (dBu =dBv) is the same as - 20 dBFS or 0 VU.
dBFS - Decibels relative to full scale. The level of 0 dBFS is assigned to the maximum possible digital level. <br>  </p>
<p class="code" style= "text-align:left;"  > LUFS/LKFS - Loudness Units referenced to Full Scale (based 1LU=1dB). 2011 standard. <br>  </p>
